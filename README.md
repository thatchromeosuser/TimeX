# TimeX
TimeX is an app where you can freely manage your time through highly customizable Alarms.

# Features (from base app)
* Low volume gentle alarm which starts some time before the main alarm (when you are in good sleep phase to wake up, you will hear the low volume alarm and wake up most refreshed. 30 minutes is most of the time enough to catch the fast sleep phase)
* Cool time picker like in Jelly Bean. No more spinning, only phone-style keyboard!
* Volume fade in and vibration starting only after completed fade in
* Snooze for some time with one click or to a snooze to selected time with out time picker
* Longclick to dismiss - prevents accidental alarm dismiss
* Longclick on snooze button for adjustable snooze time with a convenient time picker

# Planned Features
* Timer (with label).
* Changable backgrounds for each alarm.
* Alarm categories
* Move alarms within list
* Customizable dismiss method for each alarm.

# Open source
The application code is branched from AOSP and is open source. Additional feature requests are appreciated! You can submit bugreports and feature requests by sending an email to developers (just me)!
